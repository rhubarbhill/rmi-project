        <p>
            In the modern day, Sims' accomplishments, while undeniable, are inextricably linked to slavery and racial dynamics. 
            The removal of his statue from Central Park in 2018 came about as a result of an impassioned protest from four activist 
            women who painted their clothes and gave a demonstration, arguing that Sims simply could not have obtained "consent" 
            in any traditional sense for his brutal experiments administered with no anesthesia.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professor L. Lewis Wall defies modern critiques of Sims, arguing that we're judging him through a "presentist lens," 
            unfairly applying our modern values of autonomy, social justice, and racial equality and letting "retrospective indignation" 
            distort our ability to understand history as it was. As argued before by Sims himself, the fistula problem was considered 
            incurable and experimentation was a vital step in order to combat an "incurable" problem, and it was such an awful disease 
            that women were understandably willing to do anything to have it cured.
        </p>

                <p>
                    However, this proposition still sidesteps the systemic racism and biological racism (such as the myth that black 
                    bodies were more resistant to pain) that informed Sims' decisions to cure them the way he did and his later apathy 
                    to fully crediting them in his work or acknowledging their suffering or enslaved status. The women's ability to give 
                    what could be considered "informed consent" is also highly dubious from an ethical standpoint. Prof. Rueben C. Warren 
                    and his colleagues argue that the means can never justify the ends, and that Anarcha, Lucy, and Betsey must at least 
                    be honored as the "Mothers of Modern Gynecology" for what they went through.

        <p>
            The removal of Sims' statue from Central Park can also be considered part of a larger trend to remove as many tributes 
            to America's racist past as possible, echoing the removal of many Confederate monuments and statues across the South for 
            similar reasons. Within the legacy of medical ethics itself, Sims' exploitation can be considered part of a long lineage 
            of injustice towards marginalized groups such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and ongoing racial disparities in providing 
            healthcare.
