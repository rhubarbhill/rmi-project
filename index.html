                    In the modern day, <strong>Dr. J. Marion Sims</strong> (1813-1883, pictured) is widely recognized
                    as the "father of modern gynecology." He is most famously credited with pioneering the first successful
                    and repeatable surgical technique to repair vesico-vaginal fistulas (VVFs) among women. VVF was a
                    complication caused by obstructed labor that led to urinary and fecal incontinence. Any women who had
                    it were often socially ostracized for it, sometimes committing suicide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the surgical community at the time, it was considered an incurable condition, and Sims had to undertake a lot of
                    medical experimentation over multiple years in his attempt to find a way to reliably repair VVF. He developed a
                    technique that used silver sutures which could successfully close the fistula and cure women permanently.

        <p>
            This technique, however, was developed through many failed attempts at surgery on many enslaved women, including 
            three very critical women named <strong>Anarcha</strong>, <strong>Betsey</strong>, and <strong>Lucy</strong>. These were
            essentially surgical experiments, performed without anesthesia and initially with other surgeons watching as the patient
            experienced excruciating pain, perpetuating the idea that black women were more resistant to pain. By modern ethical
            standards, "consent" could not have been obtained and the women were treated more as medical subjects than autonomous
            human beings.

        </p>

        <p>
            After his successful stint with curing VVF, he went on to enjoy a fruitful and fulfilling medical career, founding the
            New York Women's Hospital and serving as president of the American Medical Association in 1876. His innovations in
            gynecology became standard practice and he was internationally recognized (see the contemporary news column to the
            left). However, he was silent about the enslaved women who helped him make his innovations, omitting to mention them at
            all in his initial publications about fistula treatment and minimizing their role and suffering in later speeches.

                    Owing to his accomplishments and likeable character amongst his colleagues, his friends raised money to have a statue
                    made of him following his death. It was first placed in New York City's Bryant Park in October 1894 then later moved to
                    Central Park. However, in 2018, as modern society re-assessed his legacy so entangled with that of slavery, his statue
                    was removed and taken to Sims' burial ground in Brooklyn's Green Wood Ceremony.

                    He is an undeniably important figure in gynecology, but his work is inseparable from the racial and ethical injustices
                    embedded in his methods. Some authors, such as Prof. L. Lewis Wall, have argued that Sims' actions cannot be judged
                    appropriately by modern standards, while others, such as Prof. Durrenda Ojanuga and Prof. Rueben C. Warren, believe that
                    he undeniably violated ethical and medical standards even at the time.

        <p>
            Regardless of one's stance on this, it is still important to at least shine a light on the enslaved women who 
            were involved in this man's work and understand the history...
