                    Some of the key individuals that helped Sims come up with a cure for VVF include three enslaved
                    women named
                    <strong>Anarcha</strong>, <strong>Betsey</strong>, and <strong>Lucy</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1845, <strong>Anarcha</strong> was a 17-year-old enslaved woman on the Wescott plantation, close
                    to Montgomery,
                    Alabama. She endured a traumatic labor that lasted over 72 hours, and she developed a severe fistula
                    in the process.
                    Sims initially considered her "hopelessly incurable."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At around the same time, <strong>Betsey</strong> (from Lowndes County, Alabama), of a close age to Anarcha,
                    suffered a
                    similar fistula following childbirth and was also considered incurable. <strong>Lucy</strong>, an
                    eighteen-year-old also
                    from Montgomery County, also suffered a similar case but even more severe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite deeming all three of them incurable, the women's respective owners still requested Sims' help as he
                    was known for curing even the most inexplicable and difficult cases. Shortly after his calling the three
                    incurable, Sims received an emergency case with a white woman suffering a pelvic injury. In the process, he
                    changed his tune as he considered new methods that could potentially cure VVF.
                </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Sims told Anarcha and Betsey's respective owners, Wescott and Harris, "If you will give me Anarcha and
            Betsey for experiment, I agree to perform no experiment or operation on either of them to endanger their
            lives, and will not charge a cent for keeping them, but you must pay their taxes and clothe them. I will
            keep them at my expense." In addition to these two and Lucy, other women were also referred to Sims and
            lived in his infirmary where they "helped to care for each other physically and emotionally, forming a
            sisterhood of shared suffering."
        </p>
        <p>
            Lucy's case was the most severe, so she received treatment first in what was an excruciating experimental
            process that lasted an hour, was viewed by multiple other physicians Sims invited to watch, and almost led
            to her death even as the operation failed. Sims continued to house the women for the next four years as he
            refined his experiments and continued to work on them without anesthesia, before eventually developing the
            "silver sutures" method mentioned previously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sims' memoir presents the women as willing participants who were "all perfectly satisfied" with what he was
            doing for them, framing them as cooperative and devoted to his work, but this is dubious given the power
            dynamics of slavery and the fact that he is the only voice on this matter, in an autobiography written many
            years after the fact. No testimony from the enslaved women themselves was ever recorded or obtained. To some
            extent, they certainly had to be cooperative in order for the delicate surgeries to be successful, but the
            degree to which they cooperated beyond this point is unknown.

        <p class="mt-5">
            Sims further justified his actions in his autobiography by claiming the women were desperate for a cure and
            therefore participated of their own volition, emphasizing his work as their best hope for finding relief and
            ultimately a medical necessity. Current-day professor Lewis L. Wall argues a similar case in that we must
            consider the context of the time: VVF was simply not an easily curable condition as it is today, and that
            women at the time were willing to do anything to be cured of such an awful condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wall also comments that while anesthesia was available, it still wasn't widely accepted by all surgeons as a
            safe and effective tool yet, and VVF repair was regarded as a "small operation" that didn't require
            anesthesia, though one could question how that stance did not change as Sims observed his patients in great
            pain. Still, he did provide pain relief medications and diets "of a constipating character" to help them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sims often saw women less as people and more as medical cases or stepping stones to scientific discovery. As
            mentioned
            in the previous page, Sims rarely acknowledged the enslaved women's role in his publications or speeches,
            and he either
            neglected or downplayed their enslaved status. In his first publication about his VVF work, <em>"On the
                Treatment of
                Vesico-Vaginal Fistula,"</em> he didn't mention the women's enslaved status. In an 1857 speech, he
            merely described
            Anarcha as "a young colored woman." At the very least, he did acknowledge their suffering, declaring:

                    In contrast, the obituary written for Sims was not particularly kind to the enslaved women, blaming
                    them for
                    "their own disinclination to send for medical assistance even when labour was protracted" and
                    absolving their
                    masters of all potential blame. Evidently, time did not look upon this attitude very kindly.
